# Open Source Contribution Bootcamp

## Workflow of open source

1. Find the project which you want to contribute
2. We have to find a task to which we are contribute we will find that in -> Issues tab
3. Don't wait for an issue to be assigned to you unless its an big issue

### Issues Tab

1. Issues are like tasks like features , reporting bugs etc. If we find a bug on the project we can also report that in the issues tab of the open source project
2. There will be **lables** for the issues
3. There will be **unique ID** for every issue
4. We can filter the issues with the help of **Lables** : These lables or tags are added by the maintainers , There can be multiple issues
5. Search for **good first issue** : Typos , UI or UX or small issues
6. **Quick Wins** : The first person who fixes the issues

#### Reporting new issues : There will be issue template in the .github folder on the opensource folder
